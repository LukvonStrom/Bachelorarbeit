To construct the reference architectures, a set of offerings from the \ac{AWS} Cloud is to be examined and compared against each other.
To ensure maximum utility, feedback and input is collected in various forms throghout the construction process from SPIRIT/21 GmbH, the company applying the constructed reference architectures.
